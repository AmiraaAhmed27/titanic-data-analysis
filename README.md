Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to explore survival rates among passengers based on different attributes such as gender and age. The analysis provides insights into:

-The number of men and women on board and how many survived.

-The distribution of passengers across various age groups and their corresponding survival rates.

-The overall breakdown of passengers based on gender and age.


Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers on the RMS Titanic. The dataset includes features like:


-assenger class

-Gender

-Age

-Fare

-Survival status

Key Insights

Survival by Gender:

Age Group Survival:
Passengers were segmented into age groups, and survival rates were calculated for each group to identify patterns.

Passenger Breakdown:
A detailed breakdown of the number of passengers by gender and age to understand the overall demographic distribution on the ship
